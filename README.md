# Competitive Coding - Templates

This repository contains different templates of different Data Structure and Algorithms used in CP.

* The Codes are in java.
* All the templates have faster I/O support.

## List of all the templates :

1. Default Template
2. Fenwick Tree or Binary Indexed Tree
3. Segment Tree
4. Square Root Decoomposition
5. Graphs with DFS and BFS
6. Graph with Dijkstra's Algorithm
7. Matrix with DFS
8. Sorting of Pair Data Structure
9. Sieve of Erthonesis - Prime Numbers
10. Disjoint Set Union
11. Trees With LCA
12. Graph With Minimum spanning Tree
13. Modulu Inverse
14. Convex Hull
